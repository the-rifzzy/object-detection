# Object Detection using HTML

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates **Object Detection using HTML and JavaScript**. It runs directly in the browser and detects objects from images or live camera feed using a pre-trained object detection model. The goal of this project is to show how object detection can be implemented on the **frontend without backend processing**.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript
* Pre-trained Object Detection Model (e.g., COCO-SSD / TensorFlow.js)
* Browser APIs (Camera / Image handling)

## ✨ Features

* Detects multiple objects in real time
* Displays bounding boxes and labels
* Works directly in the web browser
* No server or database required
* Simple and lightweight implementation

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Download or clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/the-rifzzy/object-detection.git
   ```
2. Open the project folder.
3. Double-click `final project.html` **or** open it using a browser.
4. Allow camera access (if real-time detection is used).

## 🧠 How It Works

* The object detection model is loaded in the browser.
* Input is taken from an image or live webcam.
* The model processes the input and detects objects.
* Bounding boxes and object names are displayed on the screen.

## 📸 Sample Output

* Person
* Mobile Phone
* Bottle
* Laptop
  (Detected objects vary based on input)

## 📈 Applications

* Surveillance systems
* Smart cameras
* Educational demonstrations
* AI-based web applications

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* Improve detection accuracy
* Add image upload option
* Support multiple models
* Improve UI/UX
